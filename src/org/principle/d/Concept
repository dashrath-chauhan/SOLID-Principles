Dependency Inversion Principle

High level modules should not depend on low level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

- never depend on anything concrete, only depend on abstractions
- Abstraction should not depend on details, but details should depend abstraction
- able to change an implementation easily without altering the high level code
