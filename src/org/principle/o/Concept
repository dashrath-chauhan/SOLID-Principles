Open/Closed Principle + Specification Design Pattern(Enterprise Design Pattern)

An entity should be open for extension but closed for modification.

Goal - to get to a point where you can never break the core of your system.

- if want an extra feature, extend the functionality by adding new code, instead of chaning into existing one
- seperate the behavious, so the system can easily be extended, but never broken
