Liskov Substituion Principle + Factory Design Pattern

A base class should be replacable by subclass without breaking the actual functinality/implementation.

- any derived class should be able to substitute its parent class without the consumer knowing about it
- every class that implements an interface, must be able to substitute any reference throughout the code that implements that same interface
- every part of the code should get the expected result no matter what instance of a class you send to it, given it implements the same interface
